    Stephen's speech module is broken.
    This module is responsible for his number pronunciation.
    He has to click to input all of the numerical digits in a figure,
    so when there are big numbers it can take him a long time.
    Help the robot to speak properly and increase his number processing speed by writing a new speech module for him.
    All the words in the string must be separated by exactly one space character.
    Be careful with spaces -- it's hard to see if you place two spaces instead one.

<p><strong>Input: </strong>A number as an integer.</p>

<p><strong>Output: </strong>The string representation of the number as a string.</p>

<div class="for_info_only">
    <p>
        <strong>Example:</strong>
    </p>
    
{% if interpreter.slug == "js-node" %}
<pre class="brush: python">speechModule(4)=='four'
speechModule(143)=='one hundred forty three'
speechModule(12)=='twelve'
speechModule(101)=='one hundred one'
speechModule(212)=='two hundred twelve'
speechModule(40)=='forty'
</pre>
{% else %}
<pre class="brush: python">checkio(4)=='four'
checkio(143)=='one hundred forty three'
checkio(12)=='twelve'
checkio(101)=='one hundred one'
checkio(212)=='two hundred twelve'
checkio(40)=='forty'
</pre>
{% endif %}

    <strong>How it is used: </strong>
    This concept may be useful for the speech synthesis software or automatic reports systems.
    This system can also be used when writing a chatbot by assigning words or phrases numerical
    values and having a system retrieve responses based on those values.
