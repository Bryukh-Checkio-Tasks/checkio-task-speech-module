    <p>"Stephen, how much do we still have to load?" Called out Nikola from the cargo hold.</p>

    <p>"Plus or minus seventy eight tons. Margin of error equals sixty tons"</p>

    <p>"No way, we can’t fit that much weight on the ship!"</p>

    <p>"Ouch, that hurts! I meant to say exactly five, no, five hundred tons. Errrr..."</p>

    <p>Sofia stopped tinkering with the dashboard and looked at Stephen, who also seemed to be surprised at his own
        words.</p>

    <p>Nikola interrupts Stephens confusion, "Stephen, how many Sofias do you see now?"</p>

    <p>"Three... six... four hundred and twenty eight... mama miaaaa..." he shakes his head and shuts his eyes
        tight.</p>

    <p>"Nikola, where is your demonic exorcism device thingamabob?" Sofia asks.</p>

    <p>"Huh, you’ve never referred to my language programmator like that before," said Nikola poking his head around the
        corner. "Why do you need it?"<a class="more"><b>More...</b></a></p>

        <p>"It looks like our big friend has got a big problem with another module. This time it looks like his speech
            module has been affected; he can't recall the correct numbers!" </p>

        <p>"Stephen!" Nikola shouted as he walked back down the hall. "Can you tell me how many stars there are in our
            galaxy?"</p>

        <p>"About seven, or maybe eighteen."</p>

        <p>"Calm down Sofia, he’s always fuzzy about numbers. He'll be fine!"</p>

        <p>"Har, Har - very funny. Go get that thingamajig. We need to fix this guy."</p>

<p>Stephen's speech module is broken. This module is responsible for his number pronunciation. He has to click to input
    all of the numerical digits in a figure, so when there are big numbers it can take him a long time. Help the robot
    to speak properly and increase his number processing speed by writing a new speech module for him. All the words in the string must be separated by exactly
    one space character.</p>

<p><strong>Input: </strong>An integer from 0 to 999.</p>

<p><strong>Output: </strong>A string representation of this number.</p>

        <strong>Example:</strong>
    </p>
    <pre class="brush: python">checkio(4)=='four'
checkio(143)=='one hundred forty three'
checkio(12)=='twelve'
checkio(101)=='one hundred one'
checkio(212)=='two hundred twelve'
checkio(40)=='forty'

    <strong>How it is used: </strong>
    It  can be useful for the speech synthesis software or automatic reports systems.
